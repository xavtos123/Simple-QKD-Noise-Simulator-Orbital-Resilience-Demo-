# Simple-QKD-Noise-Simulator-Orbital-Resilience-Demo-
Basic Python QKD noise simulator modeling orbital-scale barriers in quantum key distribution. This is like a radio game in space: QKD shares secret keys, but "noise" (static from stars or sun) messes it up. The script simulates noise and "fixes" it.
